Purpose: In this assignment we essentially convert the program we created in Assignment 3 into a program
written in C++ using overloading operators. It was designed using the model–view–controller design.

Commands used: make clean
					make
					       				
	       
Launching and Operating instructions:  Extract the files
											   Run the program. 
											    ./mechanicshop
											    
											    Note:  you can follow the example that prof gives on the assignment or follow below. 
											    
											   1.  Then input the number 1.
											   2.  Then input number 2 if you want to add a customer. Complete all details.
											   3.  Input number 1 to see if the customer is added.
											   4.  Input number 3 to add vehicle. You will be asked to input Customer ID.
											   5.  Input 1008. Note: It will tell you that the Customer Id is Invalid.
											   6.  Input 1006. Add the required information.
											   7.  Input number 1 to see if the vehicle added to customer with ID 1006.
											   8. Input Number 4 to remove customer. You will be asked to input Customer ID.
											   9.  Input 1008. Note: It will tell you that the Customer Id is Invalid.
											   10.  Input 1005. Customer will be successfully removed.
											   11. Input Number 5 to remove Vehicle. You will be asked to input Customer ID.
											   12.  Input 1008. Note: It will tell you that the Customer Id is Invalid.
											   13.  Input 1005. It will tell you to choose a vehicle from the range of numbers provided.
											   14. If you input an invalid number, it will prompt you. otherwise, it'll successfully removes the vehicle.
											   15. Input 6 to print all the Mechanics.
											   16.  Quit by inputting 0.
											   
											  The ouput should be exactly the same as shown in the sample.
																						 
											 To check any memory leaks:
											 valgrind ./mechanicshop
											 Note:  valgrind reports that some memory on the heap is “still reachable”. Prof said not to worry about it.
