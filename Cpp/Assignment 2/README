Purpose: In this assignment you will essentially convert the program you created in Assignment 1 into a program
written in C++ using classes and object oriented design principles. A large part of this program has been
provided to you to build from. It was designed using the model–view–controller design pattern that you
should be familiar with.

Commands used: make
					       				
	       
Launching and Operating instructions:  Extract the files
											   Run the program. Then input the number 1.
											   The ouput should be exactly the same as shown in the sample
											 ./mechanicshop
											 
											 To check any memory leaks:
											 valgrind ./mechanicshop
											 Note:  valgrind reports that some memory on the heap is “still reachable”. Prof said not to worry about it.
