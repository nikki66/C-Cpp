/*The ShopController class contains a function called initCustomers which we will use to populate
the program with data. This function will create dynamically allocated objects. It will work as
follows. First it will create a Customer object followed by several Vehicle objects. Adds the
Vehicle objects to the Customer using the Customerâ€™s addVehicle member function. Once a
Customer object has had all of its Vehicles added, Adds the Customer to the Shop
object using its addCustomer member function. This is done until the data fill requirements
have been met.*/
