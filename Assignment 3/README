Purpose: In this assignment we essentially convert the program we created in Assignment 2 into a program
written in C++ using linked classes instead of array classes. It was designed using the model–view–controller design.

Commands used: make clean
					make
					       				
	       
Launching and Operating instructions:  Extract the files
											   Run the program. 
											    ./mechanicshop
											    
											   1.  Then input the number 1.
											   2.  Then input number 2 if you want to add a customer. Complete all details.
											   3.  Input number 1 to see if the customer is added.
											   4.  Input number 3 to add vehicle. You will be asked to input Customer ID.
											   5.  Input 1008. Note: It will tell you that the Customer Id is Invalid.
											   6.  Input 1006. Add the required information.
											   7.  Input number 1 to see if the vehicle added to customer with ID 1006.
											   8.  Quit by inputting 0.
											   
											  The ouput should be exactly the same as shown in the sample.
																						 
											 To check any memory leaks:
											 valgrind ./mechanicshop
											 Note:  valgrind reports that some memory on the heap is “still reachable”. Prof said not to worry about it.
